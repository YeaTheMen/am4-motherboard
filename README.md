# AM4-Motherboard
Hello all aspiring PCB Designers and Computer Enthusiests

I have been working on designing a custom AMD Ryzen AM4 based Motherboard
And uploading all my resources and parts publicly so any of you
can contribute or perhaps design your own boards to.

This project is current on hold for a while as per the expensives
of testing and working on. I will leave this project up for the resources
I have found/made for any of you freely use and play around with.
May come back to this project in the future

Ahmen my brothers
